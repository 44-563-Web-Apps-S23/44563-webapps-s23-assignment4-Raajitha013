             <h5 class="name HENRIETTE" >HENRIETTE.</h5> <p class="speech">What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?</p>

             <h5 class="name JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> <p class="speech">You can easily guess.</p>
             
             <h5 class="name HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> <p class="speech">You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.</p>
             
             <h5 class="name JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> <p class="speech">I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
             am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?</p>
             
             <h5 class="name HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> <p class="speech">Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
             good friends! And now you're going to be angry.</p>
             
             <h5>JACQUES.</h5> <p>Why?</p>
             
             <h5 class="name HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5> <p class="direction">[_With an air of great importance._] A great change is taking
                place in the hearts of us women. We have resolved henceforward not to be
                treated as dolls, but as creatures of reason. As for me, I am most
                unfortunate, for nobody ever did anything but flatter me. I have always
                been too self-satisfied, too----</p>
             
             <h5 class="name JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5> <p class="speech">You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?</p>
