    <h6>MODESTY By Paul Hervieu</h6>
    <body>
        <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5><p>What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?</p>
        <h5>JACQUES.</h5><p>You can easily guess.</p>
        <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5><p>You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.</p>
        <h5>JACQUES.</h5><p>I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. Iam unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?</p>
        <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5><p>Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such good friends! And now you're going to be angry.</p>
        <h5>JACQUES.</h5><p>Why?</p>
        <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5><p>Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd like.</p>
