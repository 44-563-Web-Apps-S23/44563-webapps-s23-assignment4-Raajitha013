             HENRIETTE. What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?

             JACQUES. You can easily guess.
             
             HENRIETTE. You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.
             
             JACQUES. I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
             am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?
             
             HENRIETTE. Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
             good friends! And now you're going to be angry.
             
             JACQUES. Why?
             
             HENRIETTE. Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd like.
             
             JACQUES. You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?
