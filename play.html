             <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5> <p>What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?</p>

             <h5>JACQUES.</h5> <p>You can easily guess.</p>
             
             <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5> <p>You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.</p>
             
             <h5>JACQUES.</h5> <p>I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
             am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?</p>
             
             <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5> <p>Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
             good friends! And now you're going to be angry.</p>
             
             <h5>JACQUES.</h5> <p>Why?</p>
             
             <h5>HENRIETTE.</h5> <p>Because I'm not going to give you the sort of answer you'd like.</p>
             
             <h5>JACQUES.</h5> <p>You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?</p>
