    <h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5>
    <p class="speech">What is it? Is it so terribly embarrassing?</p>

    <h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5>
    <p class="speech">You can easily guess.</p>

    <h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5>
    <p class="speech">You're so long-winded. You make me weary--come to the point.</p>

    <h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5>
    <p class="speech">I'll risk all at a stroke--My dear Henriette, we are cousins. I
        am unmarried, you--a widow. Will you--will you be my wife?</p>

    <h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Oh, my dear Jacques, what _are_ you thinking of? We were such
        good friends! And now you're going to be angry.</p>

    <h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5>
    <p class="speech">Why?</p>

    <h5 class="HENRIETTE">HENRIETTE.</h5>
    <p class="direction">[_With an air of great importance._]</p>
    <p class="speech">A great change is taking
        place in the hearts of us women. We have resolved henceforward not to be
        treated as dolls, but as creatures of reason. As for me, I am most
        unfortunate, for nobody ever did anything but flatter me. I have always
        been too self-satisfied, too----</p>

    <h5 class="JACQUES">JACQUES.</h5>
    <p class="speech">You don't--you don't think I'd make a good husband?</p>
